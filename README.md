### Keylogger Detector

---

#### Overview
This repository contains a simple Python script designed to detect potential keylogger activity on a system. Keyloggers are malicious programs that record keystrokes, posing significant security risks by capturing sensitive information such as passwords and financial data.

#### Usage
To use this detector:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```
   pip install keyboard
   ```
3. Run the script by executing:
   ```
   python keylogger_detector.py
   ```
4. The detector will continuously monitor for key presses of suspicious keys (`F12`, `Ctrl`, `Alt`, `Shift`).

#### How It Works
The script utilizes the `keyboard` library to check if any of the specified suspicious keys are pressed. Upon detecting such key presses, it prints a message indicating potential keylogger activity. Additional actions like alerting or logging can be integrated into the script based on specific needs.

#### Customization
You can customize the list of `suspicious_keys` in the `detect_keylogger` function to include or exclude keys based on your specific monitoring requirements.

#### Important Notes
- This script is designed for educational and awareness purposes to help detect potential threats.
- It is not foolproof and should not be relied upon as the sole method for detecting all types of keyloggers.
- Use in conjunction with other security measures for comprehensive protection.

#### Contributions
Contributions to enhance the functionality or improve the detection capabilities are welcome. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
